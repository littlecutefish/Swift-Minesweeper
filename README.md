A classic Minesweeper game built with SwiftUI.

## Features

- Customizable game board size (rows and columns)
- Adjustable number of bombs
- Flag cells with long press
- Auto-revealing of adjacent empty cells

## How to Play

1. **Start Screen**: Configure your game by adjusting:
   - Number of rows (5-20)
   - Number of columns (5-20)
   - Number of bombs (1-â…“ of total cells)

2. **Game Controls**:
   - **Tap** a cell to reveal it
   - **Long press** a cell to flag/unflag it as a potential bomb
